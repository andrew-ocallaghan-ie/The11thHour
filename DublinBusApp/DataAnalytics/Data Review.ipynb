    "## Definitions and Terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signature:\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">For the intents and purposes of this review a signature is a pattern of blocks/bus stops which a bus visits. For each unique Journey_Pattern_ID it is expected that the signitures for different journeys are identical (or atleast closely resemble one another).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\"> The signatures for LineIds and Journey_Pattern_IDs do not correspond. After investigating this phenomena it was determined that Journey_Pattern_IDs are the most trustworthy and convinient soure for LineID and direction infromation.\n",

    "## Columns Info:\n",
    "This section concerns columns and their ambiguities and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "   ### Timestamp: \n",
    "   \n",
    "           - A large int representing the time (to microsecond precision) since UNIX Epoch.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   ### Line_ID:\n",
    "   \n",
    "           - Identifies the \"line\"/route of the bus. Many of these appear to be incorrect; \n",
    "       \n",
    "           - Using signitures we can differentiate between different paths buses have taken. \n",
    "               - Many of these signitures do not correspond to the Line that we expect from the LineID.\n",
    "       \n",
    "           - The LineID infromation can be re-derived form the Journey_Pattern_ID infromation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   ### Direction:\n",
    "   \n",
    "           - It was expected that this would signify a sort of \"inbound/outbound\" nature for a particular Journey Pattern.\n",
    "               - It is infact a constant column. \n",
    "   \n",
    "           - This can be re-derived using info from Journey_Pattern_ID\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "   ### Journey_Pattern_ID: (IMPORTANT)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "           - It is expected that this uniqely identifies (or implies) a certain  signiture or pattern.\n",
    "               - The path which a bus has taken.\n",
    "       \n",
    "           - We believe a Vehicle_Pattern_ID describes a set of Block_IDs (which in turn describe a set of Stop_IDs).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "           - The First FOUR characters of this give a \"stronger\" indication of the route than Line_ID.\n",
    "               - e.g 029Axxxx implies that the route is the 29A (often conflict with the Line_ID)\n",
    "       \n",
    "           - The fifth character seems to carry some form of \"directional\" infromation. \n",
    "               - xxxx1--- and xxxx0--- will have a similar number of occurances. \n",
    "                   - (As expected on an inbound/outbound route behaviour.)\n",
    "       \n",
    "           -The remaining three characters we believe are related to the block_id. \n",
    "               - The current working hypothesis is that they describe the departure/destination block\n",
    "                   - (i.e. the src of the journey or its final destination)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ### Time_Frame:\n",
    "      \n",
    "           - The similar to the date in the timestamp. \n",
    "               - it concerns a period of time begining at 6am and ending and 3am (21 hours later).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ### Vehicle_Journey_ID:\n",
    "   \n",
    "           - An ID for a given journey (a single run from one end of the line to another)\n",
    "           - 30% nulls?\n",
    "       \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "   ### Operator\n",
    "   \n",
    "           - The Terminus/Bus Station where the buses are kept and maintained.\n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "   ### Congestion:\n",
    "   \n",
    "          - a binary column depicting if there is traffic or not?\n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "   ### Latitude / Logitude:\n",
    "   \n",
    "           - Columns giving geographic coordinates of the bus at a given time (timestamp)\n",
    "           - Can these be used to extract bus stop info\n",
    "           - \n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "   ### Delay:\n",
    "   \n",
    "           - Given in seconds. \n",
    "           - A positive delay indicates a bus running behind schedule.\n",
    "           - A negative delay indicates a bus running ahead of schedule.\n",
    "           - A delay of zero would be a bus exatly on time.\n",
    "           - From investigation, Delay is relative to schedule. Some results are in conflict\n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "   ### Block_ID:\n",
    "   \n",
    "            - A section id of the journey pattern. Describes a set of Stop_IDs\n",
    "            - Can different routes overlap on Blocks?\n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "   ### Vehicle_ID:\n",
    "   \n",
    "           - Uniquly identifies a physical bus.\n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "   ### Stop_ID:\n",
    "   \n",
    "            - Uniquely identifies a bus stop. E.g. stop 570 is the physical bus stop at the top of Thormanby Woods.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### At_stop:\n",
    "  \n",
    "          - Binary column which signifies if a bus is at a bus stop or not.\n",
    "          - Does it pick up when a bus passes a bus stop, or only when it has stopped at one in that journey\n",
    "          - Or only when a timestamp signal is sent out, while it is at the stop (if those two overlap exactly)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Data Quality:\n",
    " \n",
    "         - Nulls do not seem to be a big issue\n",
    "             - routes 4 suggests that there are only 15 nulls for that line_ID. Out of about 650,000.\n",
    "         - substantial nulls for what looks to be a niche bus route 32A seem to have 30000 nulls out of 100000.\n",
    "\n",
    "         - Data Types e.g. some entries within a single column occur as ints or strings. This can hamper analysis\n",
    "         \n",
    "         - Line_ID has incorrect values, but can be rectified using available Journey_Pattern_ID info.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         - Direction has incorrect values, but can be rectified using available Journey_Pattern_ID info.\n",

    "         - Duplicate Drops \n",
    "              Time, Journey Pattern ID, Vehicle ID, Vehicle Journey.\n",
    "              \n",
    "         \n",
    "         - Relationships.\n",
    "              - Any Feature can have many times associated to it.\n",
    "              - Journey Pattern can be used by many vehicles, and many vehicle Journey IDs\n",
    "              - Given Vehicle Journey ID, and Vehicle ID there should only have a single Journey Pattern ID for all times.\n",
    "              - A Journey Pattern ID should have a set of Block Ids associated to it. \n",
    "                   - Does a particular journey feature ALL blocks of a journey pattern ID?\n",
    "                   - Does a particular journey feature ALL stops for a given journey pattern ID?\n",
    "              - What is the relationship between operators and journey_pattern_id (expect exactly 1)\n",
    "              - Does at stop define the number of times a bus stops (to let passengers on and off) for a journey\n",
    "              - Can we find the time when a bus is nearest a stop! \n",
    "                   \n",
    "             Check for nulls, drop nulls, re-check unique list if \"null\" still appears it means it is a str \"null\"\n",
    "             These nulls exist in journey pattern id. These need to be checked for other peculiar unique values.\n",
    "             \n",
    "             - Do we wish to use coordinates to calculate distance and speed, (for someone looking to compare travel speeds)\n",
