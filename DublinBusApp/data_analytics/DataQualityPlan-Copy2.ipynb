    "# Data Quality Plan\n",
    "Analysing the Dublin Bus Data provided to optimise model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Each file has about 750,000 rows. Three quarters of a million. The data has been analysed extensivly. The purpose of this document is to analyses the raw data and its weaknesses and then try ogranise it in a useable way and synthesise it to be suitable for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideas to handle data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Incremental Handing__:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each file is big, handling multiple files and multiple dataframes which have the same scale as the files is expensive on memory.\n",
    "The files are currently supplied as the global dublin bus data for a given day. For handling, it would be preferable instead of having a csv file representing the full fleet for a day, if we could look at a single route for the month. (partition based on route pattern instead of day)\n",
    "\n",
    "Having data partitioned by routes makes it more internally consistent. Rows and sets of rows are more comparable with eachother as they pass the same sets of stops. Different routes operates relatively independently so we can split these into sizeable yet relatively independent parts. This structure is optimal since we wish to analyse and model each route individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process should be completed iteritively. Iterate through each file to extract every possible journey pattern.\n",
    "Then for each journey pattern, iterate through each file extracting, re-constructing infromation only for that journey pattern. If a programmer attempts all these tasks the dataframes rapidly use the available memory, as the meachine begins to run low on RAM and it has to access the disk (evan an ssd) performance decreases substantially. Also the process could fail due to a memory error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Re-Construction__:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From analysing the data, we can see that many columns are incorrect or null. But by knowing the relationships and semantics between different columns it is possible to reconstruct \"lost\" infromation with reasonable levels of certainty. In the handling of this data. Journey_Pattern_ID will be used to re-construct LineID and Direction and VehicleID, Timeframe and Vehicle_Journey_ID, will be used to reconstruct missing Journey_Pattern_ID infromations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Analysis and Test Cases__:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sections of this document were used to just explore the data and tease out properties of different columns to help the programmer gain understanding of the datas' structure and properties. These include certain observations about missing data, inconsistent data types and some mother anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other considerations and challenges form this data are - How to derive the route.\n",
    "How often do time stamps occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Section Division__: (A potential analytic model for the data supplied)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic: The sum of the parts gives the value of the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Many smaller data sets. This models the travel time for different sections in which the busses pass through.\n",
    "        - This reduces redundancy in the analysis of bus routes (which overlap)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Though since there are more sections than bus routes, there will be many more models to store. \n",
    "        - Given t_0 the time we can calculate t_1 (the time we arrive in section1 after traversing seciont_0)\n",
    "            - Then we apply the model for section 1 with t_1 as an input. (recirsive problem, easily described iteritavly)\n",
    "                - The total time is the sum of all the predicted times for each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Accuracy of estimation of length of a section depends on the frequancy in which a time stamp is put out.\n",
    "        - Assume a section takes 100.5 seconds to cross. \n",
    "            - if a stamp is put out every second and there are 100 time stamps in a journey.\n",
    "                - We know that the time taken is between 100 and 101 (small percentage error).\n",
    "                    - The best estimate that can be made is that that time taken is in between 100 and 102.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If a time stamp occurs only every 50 seconds.\n",
    "        - Then in a 100 second interval there could be 2 or 3 time stamps.\n",
    "            - i.e. we will predict it takes between 100 and 150.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In general: Max-Min <= x <= (n+1/n)*(Max-Min) \n",
    "        - where n is the number of timestamps for a specific journey id occuring within a section)\n",
    "            - x is the actual time taken to cross the section\n",
    "                - Maximum margine of error is 1/n\n",
    "\n",
    "### __General Goal__:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function that tests different models on a route (or a section) or whatever scope the model has.\n",
    "Run this for each section/route (whatever scope is used) storing each model. Then given a departure point and a destination we can derive the appropriate route and the sum of its sections."
