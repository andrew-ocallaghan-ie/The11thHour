Purpose: Scrape DubLinked Transport API
Understanding how to access API for Real Time info

More info: @ https://data.dublinked.ie/dataset/c9df9a0b-d17a-40ff-a5d4-01da0cf08617/resource/4b9f2c4f-6bf5-4958-a43a-f12dab04cf61/download/rtpirestapispecification.pdf

Sets Checked
RealTime Bus Info 			- accessed			- good now and up to date
Timetable Bus Info by Date 	- not accessed		- we can get historic timetable data?
Full TimeTable Bus Info		- accessed			- not sure what this is yet?
Retrieve Bus Stop Info		- accessed			- relatively static
Route List Info				- accessed			- relatively static
Operator Info				- accessed			- relatively static

-It has been evaluated that scraping the RealTime Info is not needed in the current scope of the project.
-The API however remains useful for acquiring and accessing various info about DublinBus.
	--We can extract the static data at a convenient time and save it into a text file
		---we can write it into a database and query it later to return relevant info
			---this will need to be scripted, manual handling will take too long.
		
	--if we keep our operations light, we should be able to use the API itself for testing purposes without setting up a DB
